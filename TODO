# TO DO
- How do we indicate that a CT should be synced? 
    - With a checkbox at the top?
    - In the Scene: perhaps a list of Scenes where the CTs should be synced with one another

## BUGS
- Can we hide the GCT Mirror Scene somehow (perhaps in a folder)
- When we turn off GCT, should delete Mirror Scene and existing combats
