# TO DO
- How do we indicate that a CT should be synced? 
    - With a checkbox at the top?
    - In the Scene: perhaps a list of Scenes where the CTs should be synced with one another

## BUGS
- Can we hide the GCT Mirror Scene somehow (perhaps in a folder)
- Seems to have deleted one of my Scenes
- Setting: GCT Hint
    - start paying attention to the Setting
- Initialization doesn't seem right: needs to create an Encounter; right now is just adding tokens without one
