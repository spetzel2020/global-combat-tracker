# TO DO
- How do we indicate that a CT should be synced? 
    - With a checkbox at the top?
    - In the Scene: perhaps a list of Scenes where the CTs should be synced with one another

## BUGS
- Change title of GCT popout to GCT or Global Combat Tracker
    - currently if you set it you get [object Object]
