# Description
Keeps your Scene map clean and your encounters simple by saving tokens/Actors into Quick Encounter Journal Entries:
* Design your encounters by positioning and configuring Hostile tokens, then save the tokens into a Quick Encounter Journal Entry, marked with a single Map Note on the Scene which only you the DM see
* Run your Quick Encounter by clicking the "Add to Combat Tracker" button; all your saved tokens will be positioned back on the map and added to the Combat Tracker, ready to fight!
* Run encounters from converted or packaged modules with embedded Actors
* Easily scale-up encounters by changing "3 Zombies" to "10 Zombies"
* Similar to the Encounter ability in Fantasy Grounds
* For Roving Encounters move a single Map Note, not many tokens
* Save your player tokens at the entrance to a new Scene too!

Quick Encounters works well with [TokenMold](https://github.com/Moerill/token-mold#token-mold) to vary your tokens names, HP, etc (although TokenMold is not required for Quick Encounters). Quick Encounters also previews the XP for each group of hostiles if using dnd5e)
